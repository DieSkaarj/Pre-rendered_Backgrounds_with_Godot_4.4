# Using Pre-rendered Backgrounds with Godot 4.4.x and Blender 4.5

- The folder pre-rendered-backgrounds contains an example project for using pre-rendered background in Godot 4.4.x.

This project presents a method of overlaying 3D Actors with a static pre-rendered background. Giving a similar effect to the early Resident Evil games. However, with this method we can go infront and behind objects in a scene easily.
